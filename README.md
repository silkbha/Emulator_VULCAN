# Master Research Project
Using deep learning to emulate the VULCAN chemical kinetics code for exoplanet atmospheres.

VULCAN: [Tsai et al. 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00409), [Tsai et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01790)

### Requirements
A Conda virtual environment with all required packages can be created from one of the included yaml files.
- requirements_cpu.yaml : for PCs without a dedicated GPU
- requirements_cuda.yaml : for PCs with a CUDA-supported GPU (nVidia) [COMING SOON]

Both are identical save for a different version of the PyTorch machine learning library. Create the environment by running the following in a terminal window (change "xxx" to one of the above):

```
conda env create --file requirements_xxx.yml
```

Download the petitRADTRANS opacity and input data (https://petitradtrans.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/installation.html) and put the folder in: ./src/stellar_spectra/input_data_std. **(BEWARE: this is a ~12 GB file!)**
